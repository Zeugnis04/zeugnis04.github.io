subtitle: Welcome to Zeugnis's blog

Hi I am *Zeugnis* from South Korea. In my blog I randomly write about my interests, in a random manner. My posts are likely to talk about:

- Languages: *I love linguistics and languages*
- Typography and Calligrpahy: *I love all types of art related to letters --- including typography and calligraphy*

and maybe much more.

### My story

I have developed my interests in many different ways, even in some ways that I don't remember, but I will try my best to provide the best explanation of it. I speak Seoul Korean as a mother language and I also have near-to-mother-tongue fluency of English. I also study Japanese and Chinese (not to mention that they are both East Asian languages), and also have plans to post about them in the near future.
