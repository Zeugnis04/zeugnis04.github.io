subtitle: Welcome to Zeugnis04's blog

Hi I am Zeugnis04 from South Korea. In my blog I randomly write about my interests, in a random manner. My posts are likely to talk about:

-Languages: *I love linguistics and languages*
-Typography and Calligrpahy: *I love all types of art related to letters --- including typography and calligraphy*

and maybe much more.

### My story

I have developed my interests in many different ways, even in some ways that I don't remember, but I will try my best to provide the best explanation of it.
