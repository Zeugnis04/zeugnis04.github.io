subtitle: Welcome to Zeugnis's blog

Hi I am *Zeugnis* from South Korea. In my blog I randomly write about my interests, in a random manner. My posts are likely to talk about:

- Languages: *I love linguistics and languages*
- Typography and Calligrpahy: *I love all types of art related to letters --- including typography and calligraphy*

and maybe much more.

### My story
I have developed my interests in various ways, some of which I can barely recall. My native language is Seoul Korean, and I am also highly fluent in English. Additionally, I am studying Japanese and Chinese, both of which are East Asian languages. I plan to share posts about these languages and my learning journey in the near future.
