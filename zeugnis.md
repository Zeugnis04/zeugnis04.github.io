## Why "Zeugnis"?

One of my nicknames that I choose to use --- Zeugnis, comes from the German word Zeugnis /ˈtsɔɪ̯k.nɪs/. In contemporary German, it usually means <em>certificate</em> or *report card*, otherwise *testimony* or *witness declaration*. Meanwhile, Zeugnis in my nickname actually comes from Johann Sebastian Bach's church cantata *Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV 147*, famous for the tenth movement chorale *Jesus bleibet meine Freude*. The term Zeugnis appears in the opening chorus *Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben* as follows.
{% epigraph %}
Muß von Christo Zeugniß geben *(original orthography)*  
Muß von Christo Zeugnis geben *(current orthgraphy)*
{% endepigraph %}
This literally means 'must bear witness to Christ'. While I am not really a religious person, I have interests in religious studies and also like making connections with religious motifs --- and this is how I came up with my nickname. 

## Why "Random Access Memories"?

The name of this blog, Random Access Memories, is a homage to both the iconic Daft Punk album and the electronic computer memory. I hope this blog works as a space to capture and revisit thoughts, languages, music, and random memories or sort. It’s less of a structured archive and more of a patchwork of experiences, reflections, and observations. Each post is from a small part of my memory, archived in a manner so that myself and any of you can access it freely.
