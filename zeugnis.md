## Why "Random Access Memories"?

The name of this blog, Random Access Memories, is a homage to both the iconic Daft Punk album and the electronic computer memory. I hope this blog works as a space to capture and revisit thoughts, languages, music, and random memories or sort. Itâ€™s less of a structured archive and more of a patchwork of experiences, reflections, and observations. Each post is from a small part of my memory, archived in a manner so that myself and any of you can access it freely.
