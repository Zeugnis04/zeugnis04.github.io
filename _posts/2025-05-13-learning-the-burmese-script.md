<h2>Consonants</h2>

### Consonant letters

The Burmese script consists of 33 primary letters that represent the initial consonants of syllables, along with four additional diacritics used to modify the onset by indicating medial consonants. As an abugida, like other scripts in the Brahmic family, each consonant inherently carries the vowel a. /a̰/ (which may be realized as a reduced /ə/ in some contexts). Other vowel sounds are expressed through diacritic marks, which may appear above, below, before, or after the base consonant character.

The table that follows lists each of these consonant letters in the traditional ordering, along with their syllable onset values in both IPA and MLC transcription, as well as their names in Burmese, which either refer to their phonetic value or describe their shape.

Letters in grey indicate that they have limited usage in modern Burmese.

\*{% sidenote '' '/sʰ/ is a reflex of the earlier /tʃʰ/ and then /tsʰ/ consonants. It is still distinguished from /s/, although it is not so much aspirated as pronounced breathy, and imparts a slight breathy quality to the following vowel.'%} \*\*{% sidenote '' 'Usually in foreign words or toponyms and personal names from Sanskrit and Pali.

### Consonant stacking

In Burmese, certain consonant pairs can be written in stacked form. In these cases, the first consonant is written normally, while the second is stacked below. This stacking implies an unwritten virama (<span lang="my">်</span>), which suppresses the inherent vowel of the first letter. For example, <span lang="my">ကမ္ဘာ</span> ("world") is pronounced as <span lang="my">ကမ်ဘာ</span> (kam bha), not <span lang="my">ကမဘာ</span> (ka ma. bha).

Stacked consonants mostly occur in loanwords from Pali or Sanskrit, such as <span lang="my">အတ္တ</span> ("self"), but may also appear in informal abbreviations—for instance, <span lang="my">လက္ဖက်</span> ("tea") shortened to <span lang="my">လ္ဘက်</span>. Stacking generally involves homorganic consonants from the same consonant group (<span lang="my">ဝဂ်</span>), and non-grouped consonants can only be stacked with themselves.

## Vowels

### Vowel letters

Burmese has seven letters to indicate independent vowels --- primarily used when spelling words of Pali or Sanskrit etymology. 

| Letter     | <span lang="my">ဣ</span><br>i.<br>/ʔḭ/ | <span lang="my">ဤ</span><br>i<br>/ʔì/ | <span lang="my">ဥ</span><br>u.<br>/ʔṵ/ | <span lang="my">ဦ</span><br>u<br>/ʔù/ | <span lang="my">ဧ</span><br>e<br>/ʔè/ | <span lang="my">ဩ</span><br>au:<br>/ʔɔ́/ | <span lang="my">ဪ</span><br>au<br>/ʔɔ̀/ |
| Equivalent | <span lang="my">အိ</span>              | <span lang="my">အီ</span>             | <span lang="my">အု</span>              | <span lang="my">အူ</span>             | <span lang="my">အေ</span>            | <span lang="my">အော</span>             | <span lang="my">အော်</span>           |

<h3>Vowel diacritics</h3>

Usually, vowels are written using diacritics and some of them have inherent tones.

### Tone marks

In Burmese orthography, tone is indicated using diacritic tone marks that interact with both the vowel nucleus and the syllable coda. The mark <span lang="my">့</span> signals a creaky tone, and is typically used with syllables that end in nasals or with vowels that inherently imply low or high tone. The mark <span lang="my">း</span> denotes a high tone, often following a nasal coda suppressed by virama or vowels that otherwise carry a creaky or low register. Tones are marked in various ways --- they may use explicit tone marks that denote tones like shown here but, as seen in the tables above they may be related to the vowels itself.

| Tone &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     | Symbol | Phonation                                             | Duration | Intensity | Pitch                                  |
|:--------|:--------|:------------------------------------------------------|:---------|:----------|:----------------------------------------|
| Low     | à       | normal                                                | medium   | low       | low, often slightly rising        |
| High    | á       | sometimes slightly breathy                            | long     | high      | high, often with a fall before a pause |
| Creaky  | a̰      | tense or creaky, sometimes with lax glottal stop      | medium   | high      | high, often slightly falling       |
| Checked | aʔ      | centralized vowel quality, final glottal stop         | short    | high      | high (in citation; can vary in context) |


## Closed syllables

### Closed glottal stop syllables

Burmese spelling retains the consonantal finals that have since merged to the glottal stop in spoken Burmese.

### Closed nasalized syllables

In Burmese, certain nasal finals exhibit behaviors similar to checked syllables ending in a glottal stop, but with important distinctions. One such feature is the use of the anusvara (<span lang="my">◌ံ</span>), which functions as a homorganic nasal marker in multisyllabic words. It may represent a final -m that modifies the vowel quality and typically implies a low tone. The anusvara is phonologically active and may appear in combination with tone markers to express high or creaky tones as well. This diacritic frequently co-occurs with vowel markers such as <span lang="my">◌ု</span>, <span lang="my">◌ွ</span>, or <span lang="my">◌ိ</span>, producing nasalized rhymes. Possible rhymes are listed in the table below.

## Medial diacritics

Burmese employs five medial diacritics to indicate additional consonant sounds that occur between the syllable-initial consonant and the vowel. These medials are attached to base consonant letters and can be combined—up to three at once—to form complex onset clusters. In addition to marking glides like /j/ and /w/ or voicelessness, some medials also reflect palatalization, especially when applied to velar consonants. For example, combinations like <span lang="my">ကျ</span> and <span lang="my">ကြ</span> (ky, kr) result in palatal affricates such as [tɕ] or [dʑ] (voiced). 

| Letter        | MLC   | IPA   | Function                                                                                  |
|:--------------|:------|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span lang="my">ျ</span>  | -y-   | /j/   | Indicates medial glide /j/ or palatalization of velars such as /c/, /cʰ/, /ɟ/, /ɲ/.        |
| <span lang="my">ြ</span>  | -r-   | /j/   | Functions similarly to <span lang="my">ျ</span>; also indicates medial /j/ or palatalization.                  |
| <span lang="my">ွ</span>  | -w-   | /w/   | Indicates medial /w/ in open syllables, or /ʊ̀~wà/ in closed ones; often combines with vowels. |
| <span lang="my">ှ</span>  | h-    | /ʰ/   | Marks voicelessness of a sonorant consonant.                                               |
| <span lang="my">္လ</span> | -l-   | /l/   | Represents medial /l/ in conservative dialects; now obsolete in standard Burmese.          |

### Possible syllables

All possible combinations of Burmese medial diacritics are shown below using the consonant <span lang="my">မ</span> ([m]) as a representative base.
