忘記他 等於忘掉了一切
mong4 gei3 taa1 dang2 jyu1 mong4 diu6 liu5 jat1 cai3
Forgetting him is like forgetting everything
等於將方和向拋掉 遺失了自己
dang2 jyu1 zoeng1 fong1 wo4 hoeng3 paau1 diu6(deu6?) wai4 sat1 liu5 zi6 gei2
Is like losing all senses of direction and losing yourself
忘記他 等於忘掉了歡喜
mong4 gei3 taa1 dang2 jyu1 mong4 diu6 liu5 fun1 hei2
Forgetting him is like forgetting all happiness
等於將心靈也鎖住 同苦痛一起
dang2 jyu1 zoeng1 sam1 ling4 jaa5 so2 zyu6 tung4 fu2 tung3 jat1 hei2
Is like locking the heart together with pain
從來只有他 可以令我欣賞自己
cung4 loi4 zi2 jau5 taa1 ho2 ji5 ling6 ngo5 jan1 soeng2 zi6 gei2
It was only him that can make you appreciate yourself
更能讓我去用愛
gang3 nang4 joeng6 ngo5 heoi3 jung6 oi3
And allow you to use love
將一切平凡事 變得美麗
zoeng1 jat1 cai3 ping4 faan4 si6 bin3 dak1 mei5 lai6
to change common things into something beautiful
忘記他 怎麼忘記得起
mong4 gei3 taa1 zam2 mo1 mong4 gei3 dak1 hei2
Forgeting him, how can I ever do that
銘心刻骨來永久記住
ming4 sam1 hak1 gwat1 loi4 wing5 gau2 gei3 zyu6
He has been inscribed in my heart and bones to forever be remembered
從此永無盡期
cung4 ci2 wing5 mou4 zeon6 kei4
from now on to eternity



You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
