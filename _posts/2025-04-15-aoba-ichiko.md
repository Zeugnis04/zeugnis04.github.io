{% newthought 'This is a belated review' %} of Aoba Ichiko's world tour in February 26th. I had the chance to attend Aoba Ichiko's concert here in Seoul.

Aoba is often described as a contemporary folk artist, but her music goes beyond simple categorization. Personally, I tend to be drawn toward more complex musical structures — perhaps music with more dense or layered arrangements. So I never thought I would be deeply captivated by any acoustic or folk-style music, which is more on the "popular" or "accessible" side. Yet, the moment I heard her 2018 album *qp*, I was completely absorbed. There's something deeply affecting about her voice, intertwined with a classical guitar — the combination is nothing short of powerful.

This concert was supposed to be consisted of songs from her upcoming album *Luminescent Creatures*, and new tracks from the album (other than the pre-released ones) were definitely mesmerizing. Her blending of “the sounds of nature” — often produced with her own voice — and her ethereal singing creates an experience that feels alive and elemental. True to the album title, her performance radiated a quiet luminescent ode to Mother Earth.

Despite being a concert focused on the new album, she also performed some older and beloved tracks like <span lang="ja">**いきのこり●ぼくら**</span> (Ikinokori●Bokura) and <span lang="ja">**月の丘**</span> (Tsuki no Oka), which happens to be my personal favorite. The moment that surprised me most was when she played <span lang="ja">**機械仕掛乃宇宙**</span> (Kikaijikake no Uchuu) — a song I never imagined hearing live. 

Someone seems to have uploaded videos from the concert on YouTube. It's definitely worth checking out.
