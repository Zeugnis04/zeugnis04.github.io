{% newthought 'I must first confess that' %} I hadn’t thoroughly engaged with *Black Country, New Road*’s earlier albums before listening to this one. While I was aware of Isaac Wood’s departure — the band’s former lead vocalist — I hadn’t had the opportunity to explore their highly acclaimed previous releases in depth. That said, this album *definitely sparked enough interest for me to revisit their earlier work*.

Opening with **Besties**, the band offers a baroque yet refreshingly modern entry point into the album. The arrangements throughout are surprisingly sophisticated — the interplay of new female vocals, saxophone, and more *classical* instrumentation comes across as both cohesive and remarkably *communal*.

The album navigates various dimensions of human relationships — not necessarily with optimism, but rather through a lens of subtle *melancholy*. This emotional tone is mirrored in the layered and often intricate instrumentation. And yet, despite the somber undercurrent, there’s a prevailing sense of *togetherness* — both in the narratives and in the way the music is composed and performed. That emotional coherence makes the album compelling not just musically, but also narratively.

After several years of lineup and repertoire changes, the UK group returns with an ambitious and unabashedly twee album overflowing with baroque flourishes and communal spirit.
