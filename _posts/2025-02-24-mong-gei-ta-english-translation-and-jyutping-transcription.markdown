This is my new (actually old) video of English translation and Jyutping Transcription.

Originally sung by 鄧麗君 (Teresa Teng), 忘記他 (Mong Gei Ta) by 關淑怡 (Shirley Kwan) is a rendition of the original song that plays a significant role in the 王家衛 (Wong Kar-Wai) movie 墮落天使 (*Fallen Angels*). The song is in Cantonese, which is a variety of 粵 (Yue), a Sinitic language mainly spoken in the current provinces of 廣東 (Guangdong) and 廣西 (Guangxi). Jyutping is one of the most popular romanization schemes for Cantonese. Lyrics in this video are transcribed in Jyutping. For more information regarding Jyutping, please refer to [Jyutping Cantonese Romanization Scheme - The Linguistic Society of Hong Kong](https://lshk.org/jyutping-scheme/), [Jyutping.org](https://jyutping.org/en/), or [Jyutping - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping).

忘記他 等於忘掉了一切  
*mong4 gei3 taa1 dang2 jyu1 mong4 diu6 liu5 jat1 cai3*  
Forgetting him is like forgetting everything.  

等於將方和向拋掉  
*dang2 jyu1 zoeng1 fong1 wo4 hoeng3 paau1 diu6*  
It's like losing all sense of direction.  

遺失了自己  
*wai4 sat1 liu5 zi6 gei2*  
And losing yourself.  

忘記他 等於忘掉了歡喜  
*mong4 gei3 taa1 dang2 jyu1 mong4 diu6 liu5 fun1 hei2*  
Forgetting him is like forgetting all happiness.  

等於將心靈也鎖住  
*dang2 jyu1 zoeng1 sam1 ling4 jaa5 so2 zyu6*  
It's like locking the heart.  

同苦痛一起  
*tung4 fu2 tung3 jat1 hei2*  
Together with pain.  

從來只有他 可以令我欣賞自己  
*cung4 loi4 zi2 jau5 taa1 ho2 ji5 ling6 ngo5 jan1 soeng2 zi6 gei2*  
It was only him who could make me appreciate myself.  

更能讓我去用愛  
*gang3 nang4 joeng6 ngo5 heoi3 jung6 oi3*  
And allow me to love.  

將一切平凡事 變得美麗  
*zoeng1 jat1 cai3 ping4 faan4 si6 bin3 dak1 mei5 lai5*  
To turn all ordinary things into something beautiful.  

忘記他 怎麼忘記得起  
*mong4 gei3 taa1 zam2 mo1 mong4 gei3 dak1 hei2*  
Forgetting him — how could I possibly do that?  

銘心刻骨來永久記住  
*ming4 sam1 hak1 gwat1 loi4 wing5 gau2 gei3 zyu6*  
He is engraved in my heart and bones, to be remembered forever.  

從此永無盡期  
*cung4 ci2 wing5 mou4 zeon6 kei4*  
From now on, for eternity.
